>That Othello will do well if he can pull this off

Iago
>Wake up Brabantio, chase him down, antagonize him, make him angry at Othello.

Roderigo
>Here's his house, I'll shout at him

Iago
>Yes! Scream at him! Of fires across the city.

Roderigo
>Brabantio! Brabantio! Wake up, Brabantio!

Iago
>Brabantio! You've got burglars in your house! Your daughters been stolen, as have your bags!

Brabantio: What the hell are you talking about? I'm trying to sleep. Leave me alone!

Iago: Are you sure you locked your doors? 

Brabantio: What's it to you?

Iago: Someones robbed your house, they stole your daughter. Get dressed, or else she's going to 
get knocked up by a black guy. Wake up!

Brabantio: Screw off, you! 

Roderigo: Brabantio, do you remember me?

Brabantio: No, who are you?

Roderigo: It's me, Roderigo!

Brabantio: I remember you now, you were chasing after my daught before. I told you then, and I'm telling you now, 
you aren't getting with her. Leave us alone!

Roderigo: No, that's not ...

Brabantio: Don't give me this, I'm have power! I'll get back at you for this, should you continue.

Roderigo: Chill!

Brabantio: Who the hell would rob me! I'm a member of parliament!

Roderigo: Brabantio, I'm here out of good will, I want whats best for you.

Iago: Brabantio, your a god damn atheist if you won't take our advice! Imagine your daughter with a horse on top of her,
with little horse children! Is that what you want?

Brabantio: Your all satanists! 

Iago: I'm the one telling you that a black guy is parking his car in your daughters garage.

Brabantio: You're a felon

Iago: Your an MP
