SUMMARY

Iago wants his bar to be more popular by getting strippers from Othello. Othello chooses to give 

strippers to Cassio’s competing bar across the street. Desdemona, Brabantio’s daughter is Othello side 

bitch. Iago tells Rodrigo to tell Brabantio about what Desdemona is doing.



SCENE DESCRIPTION

*Brabantio is passed out at a table, surrounded by thugs. Iago and Roderigo sit at the bar, cleaning and drinking*

Iago and Roderigo talk about: Othello giving Cassio's bar strippers and Iago's plans on getting back Othello by
exposing his marriage with Desdemona.

(Othello is currently at Cassio's bar, setting it up into a stripclub)

Iago then urges Roderigo to awake Brabantio.

Roderigo brings a drink to the Drug Lord's table, waking him up.

He then asks him after his daughter, turning the conversation to a rumour he has heard about her actions,
intentionally directing suspicion towards Othello

Brabantio becomes offended, but then calls one of his thugs guarding his mansion to confirm this.

After finding out the truth, he rushes out with his thugs (with a lot of guns), following Roderigo, determined to 
kill (?) Othello
